      <br>
      For our final project in Data Science we looked into Immigration in the United States and analyzed the country's reaction throughout time on the matter. We examined how the government responded to immigration, by investigating bills and ammendments proposed in Congress, as well as the way by which the press and, more precisely, the New York Times, documented the topic through its articles.
